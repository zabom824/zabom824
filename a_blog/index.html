			<p><span><b>Commercials lie.</b></span> We all know this. Ads try to hook you with the idea that buying whatever they're selling will make you cool, attractive, healthy, wealthy, and anything else that sounds good. The products themselves are disguised as innovations, but honestly most of them are trivial and a waste of cash. Do you really need Snuggies, or the new Calvin underwear, or pre-measured ingredients delivered straight to your door via Hello Fresh? Or can you just use blankets (a timeless invention), any underwear brand really, and measure ingredients that you went out to get on your own the day of, instead of waiting to have them delivered for a weekly fee of $69?</p>

			<p><span><b>Honesty</b></span> and <span><b>purpose</b></span> are very important values to me in terms of designing. I know that there are graphic design agencies out there that are not focused on getting you to lighten your wallet. They exist to actually provide solutionsâ€”the real innovators in the pack. Join me (and my disenchantment with the current popularity of the advertising field in graphic design) as I explore the two paths of communication design: the Commercial path and the Noncommercial path (which includes non-profits, information design, and design for print) in order to figure just what the hell to do with my education.</p>

				<p><q>Graphic design is, in some ways, a Frankenstein; The designer must stitch together elements from several different fields (illustration, photography, writing, psychology, sociology) to form the body, a physical manifestation of the idea they want to communicate.</q></p>
				
				<p>Maria Zabolotnaya is an aspiring graphic designer (and hobbyist writer) from Brooklyn, NY. She currently studies Communication Design at Parsons. Having originally entered Parsons as a Fine Arts student, Maria has adapted her skills as an artist for use in creating visuals for print and web design. She aims to piece together these abilities with her passion for music and creative writing and work as a designer for the music industry in the near future.</p>
