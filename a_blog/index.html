	<title>Final Project Brainstorming</title>
</head>

<body>
	<p>The theme that I chose at the beginning of this semester is <b>psychology</b>. I originally meant to focus on the psychology of design; how elements such as color, typefaces, and layout affect the minds of users. However, as we progressed further into the class, I’ve decided to expand the theme to psychology in general. For some reason when I think of the word psychology I automatically associate it with mental illness and related things. That’s not what I’m going for, although it’s an interesting direction to take it, maybe.</p>

	<p>I had a really cool idea for my next project before I knew the big, final project was a blog. My idea definitely could be included in the psychology theme; it was to make a site for people who were creeped out by a scary movie to visit and see bloopers and behind-scenes-footage of the same movie. I would also have included parodies of horror films, and funny fan-art. I was thinking of adding a section dedicated to debunking creepy urban legends/videos, etc. A working name for it was <b>descareify.me</b>, and I even wanted to contact the YouTuber Scare Theater for a possible sponsorship or collaboration. However, knowing now that our final project is a blog dedicated to our chosen word, I don’t know if this idea fits with the main theme as much as it should.</p>

	<p>I could definitely still go back to my original intentions and focus on the psychology of design though. I’m still fairly interested in that. Maybe I should change my word/theme to popular culture, since the first project that I did was on memes and the second one I want to do is on horror films.</p>
