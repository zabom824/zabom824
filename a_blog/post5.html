				<h3>Apple</h3>
				<p>I attend a university where Apple is the dominant brand of technology. By dominant, I mean approximately 1% of students have laptops that are not Macs. I am the 1%. I don&#39;t have anything against Apple in terms of its products. I agree that their user experience is well-planned and the products themselves look nice. There are also several really handy design apps that can only be used by Apple products, which is a nice bonus. It can be really frustrating being unable to use the same apps as your classmates for assignments that require them (I&#39;m looking at you, Sketch). My issue with Apple is a notorious one&emdash;that the products are made to be short-lived, so that they can constantly be replaced with a newer version.</p>

				<p>The practice I&#39;m referring to is called <q>planned obsolescence</q>. The goal of planned obsolescence is to make a product or part that will fail, or become less desirable over time or after a certain amount of use. This is not a sustainable practice, and it&#39;s a greedy one at that. When a product is constantly looking to be replaced by a new one, it creates waste. It&#39;s no wonder that iPhones crack so easily, and that it&#39;s more difficult to fix a Mac than a PC due to the availability of individual parts. If only iPhones were as durable as old-school Nokia phones. Those things could survive a nuclear holocaust. Adding durability, and ceasing to shove the latest version of the iPhone, which has only slight improvements to its former model and is really bought by consumers so that they could show off and be trendy, would significantly improve my enthusiasm for this company.</p>

				<p>Currently, I own an HP Envy laptop and a Google Nexus phone. They have faults of their own, and the HP is not as sleek as any current Macbook, but they get the job done and I am quite satisfied with them.</p>
