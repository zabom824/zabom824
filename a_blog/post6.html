				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>Music is, without a doubt, a huge source of inspiration and motivation for me. I love many different genres, ranging from classical music to industrial rock. Anything from Mozart to Marilyn Manson is what I like to say. I&#39;m one of those people that can proudly state that music has helped me through really tough times. It didn&#39;t exactly save my life, no&mdash;that was the work of people very close to me, but it sure helped make my life worth living.</p>

				<p>The first job I ever dreamed of in terms of design was to create album covers, posters, and merchandise for bands. This is still my greatest aspiration, my ultimate goal. I know very little about designing for the music industry, but I&#39;m very eager to experience it and learn. I know typography, which I assume is going to be very necessary. Ah, just thinking about band logos livens me up.</p>

				<p>I guess I&#39;m looking for to be a part of something that is so important in my life. I want to do the thing for other people that music did for me, although indirectly because I would be working on the visuals of the band rather than the sound. I would start a band, but I only know how to play piano, and my singing skills are quite rusty due to years of no practice. Who knows? Maybe I will start one in the near future. I&#39;ve already designed a logo for this hypothetical band, which by the way is called Scairytale, just like my website.</p>

				<p>If I were to go back in time and choose a different topic for this blog, it would be on music and design. I think I would have had less of a struggle in writing for music because it&#39;s something Iâ€™m much more passionate about then commercialism versus non-commercialism. </p>
