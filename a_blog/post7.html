				<h3>Social Media (and some general reflections)</h3>
				<p>I started this blog while in the middle of a battle of sorts. On one side was the path I had originally set out to take with my BFA degree, the path of advertising and commercialism. My parents encouraged me to switch from Fine Arts to Communication Design in order to pursue this path because it pays really well. On the opposing side of the battle was my growing disenchantment with the first side, and a desire to do something that was more, as I&#39;ve mentioned before, honest and purposeful. I was under the impression that graphic design was mainly focused on branding and identity, but exploring the field throughout this blog has changed my impression significantly. I know now that there is so much more to graphic design than just making logos or ads, and I know that I can incorporate my interests in order to tailor the field to be more meaningful to me. Today I was trying to come up with a topic or brand to write about that I find disagreeable, and I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn&#39;t come up with one for a while.</p>

				<p>That being said, the topic I did come up with is social media because I have actually had an unpleasant experience through an internship of working for this exact field. In the summer of 2016, I was an intern for a small branding agency called Media Explode. Their clients were local businesses around Brooklyn, which included numerous restaurants and a few stores and services. During my internship, I was given the task of creating images and taglines for use as social media posts. The task was very superficial and forced. I had to write things like <q>Tag a friend who loves chai lattes!</q> or <q>Kosher Bacon? We got it.</q> on various images of food from the client businesses. It felt very superficial and forced, and I became sort of miserable from partaking in it.  I am very thankful, however, for the experience because through it I learned that this type of work is not for me.</p>
