				<h3>Information is Beautiful Part II</h3>
				<p>I wanted to get a copy of Information is Beautiful from The New School&#39;s library but unfortunately they did not have it, and NYU is only in the process of ordering a copy, so instead I will be getting <i>Visual Miscellaneum: A Colorful Guide to the World's Most Consequential Trivia</i>. It is another bestseller from David McCandless that presents information in his iconic colorful graphs. I will update this post after I borrow the book.</p>

				<p>Update: I found Visual Miscellaneum online. I’m looking through it right now and thoroughly enjoying it, although I think that the book format is not as successful as the web format. It&#39;s missing that smooth interactivity that the site has. It&#39;s still beautiful to look at, and I recognize several of the graphs from informationisbeautiful.net. As I look through this book, I&#39;m realizing that it combines two of my favorite design fields—information design and book design—but the result is less exciting than expected. Perhaps if the site did not exist, the book itself would be more impressive since there would not be anything to compare it to. Heh, I just saw the Nerve Endings visualization.</p>

				<p>There is some very useful information that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen on the website (I may have missed it), such as the sunscreen graphs. Information like that may be worth getting the book, or at least making a copy. Another thing I&#39;m noticing is that a lot of the graphs that are printed in this book have since been updated on the web. That is another benefit of publishing something onto a website rather than a book&mdash;you can always push updates to your site but you can&#39;t go back and re-do a book once it&#39;s been published. You would have to publish a new, updated version. With work such as David McCandless&#39;, I&#39;m questioning why he even decided to go for a book format because print is too ephemeral for a subject like current information. It changes far too often. That being said, his books have become bestsellers so clearly he knows what he&#39;s doing.</p>
