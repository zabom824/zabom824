	<p><b><i>Ken Bone, </b></i>2016<br>
	Living meme</p>
	<p>Ken Bone is a man who asked a question during the second 2016 United States Presidential Election Debate, which had a town hall format in which selected undecided voters ask questions directly to the candidates. Bone asked a question about the candidatesâ€™ energy policies, but because of his name and appearance, he immediately became popular on social media as users joked about him and engaged in ironic fandom.</p>
