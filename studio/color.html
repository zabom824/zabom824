	<p>I chose two complementary colors as the backdrop for my composition, and a third color that was directly in between them on the color wheel for my foreground. I did not want to work with analogous hues because I like the sharp contrast between opposites. The foreground color's opacity was changed to 50% in order to add tinture to one side and shade to the other.</p>
