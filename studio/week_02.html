<h1>Here are some important things I learned from Chip Kidd's TEDtalk about first impressions in design</h1>

<p>Clarity is useful, and even necessary for instructional design, important notices, and daily conveniences.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Chip used the hand symbol and timer on traffic lights to demonstrate urban clarity.</li>
		<li>Other examples I can think of are instructional posters for CPR and maps/guides for tourists.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Mystery is useful for getting the viewer’s attention, or sparking their curiosity, in the case of the cover
design that Chip did for Haruki Murakami’s <i>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki</i>.</p>

<p>Including just the right amount of information in a design so that the viewer can recognize what it is but
still gets credit for figuring it out is a good technique, as shown in the design for the Diet Coke can.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>I personally thought the Coke ad was funny. I would have kept it up, but I see how some
		might think it was done in bad taste.</li>
	</ul>
