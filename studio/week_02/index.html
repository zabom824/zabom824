	<h3>Here are some important things I learned from Chip Kidd&#8217;s TEDtalk about first impressions in design</h3>

	<div id="text">
		<p>Clarity is useful, and even necessary for instructional design, important notices, and daily conveniences.
			<ul>
				<li>Chip used the hand symbol and timer on traffic lights to demonstrate urban clarity.</li>
				<li>Other examples I can think of are instructional posters for CPR and maps/guides for tourists.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Mystery is useful for getting the viewer&#8217;s attention, or sparking their curiosity, in the case of the cover design that Chip did for Haruki Murakami&#8217;s <i>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki</i>.</p>
		
		<p>Including just the right amount of information in a design so that the viewer can recognize what it is but still gets credit for figuring it out is a good technique, as shown in the design for the Diet Coke can.</p>

		<p>I personally thought the Coke ad was funny. I would have kept it up, but I see how some might think it was done in bad taste.</p>
